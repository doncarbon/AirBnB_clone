## Project Description:

This is the first part of the AirBnB clone team project.


## Command Interpreter Overview:

This command line interpreter functions as the frontend for a web application, enabling users to interact with the backend developed using Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm.

Key functionalities of the command line interpreter include:

- Creating new objects (e.g., User or Place instances)
- Retrieving objects from various sources such as files or databases
- Performing operations on objects, such as counting, computing statistics, etc.
- Updating attributes of objects
- Destroying objects
